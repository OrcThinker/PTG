#+title: PTG
#+description: Prototype Tetrislike Game. Project made to renew knowledge of SignalR websockets and a reimplementation of a mechanic from a childhood game.

* Game premise
You have a full "tetris" like cube matrix. You can move the cubes to make certains "signs". Those in turn lead to cubes dissapearing and spell being cast/skill being used
To go 1 step further I'd like the game to allow more than 1 player
The game in the beggining would aim to be PvE based. You build your "deck" (signs you can get) before the game.
Next you go to a dungeon (solo or in party) there you have X lines (X == number of players for dung)
Each player has to complete their own spells however they have the same enemy
Also in party you have static signs that allow you to switch with the other player


* Prototype (proof of concept)
- Choose class (2 classes maybe more with static decks)
- Swap cubes to cast spells
- 1 enemy / battle
